User Specific Stuff
==================

In this directory you can put your stuff you 
want to distribute without doing any messing with options.
So you can start with putting your config into conf.d.
Its the same as with general MySQL.
So you put your configfile(additions into the conf.d directory) 
and it is going to be distributed
