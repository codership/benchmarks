This is a little HOWTO.

Reminder: Check your ansible version. This Repo is build and tested against ansible 1.4.3

Right now you got no help in building you ini file.
This is going to be the file to identify your nodes.
It is going to look like this:

#v+
[galera]
my.fqdn.it  ansible_ssh_user=root leader=me
my2.fqdn.it  ansible_ssh_user=root 
54.204.173.187  ansible_ssh_user=root

[sysbench]
dns.name ansible_ssh_user=root
#v-

First we got two containers ([galera] and [sysbench]).
There you put your machines in it. You are free to use 
the DNS name or the IP for the first column.
The ansible_ssh_user option just tells which user to use
to log on the remote machine. We suggest to deploy your
public key on that nodes.
One of the galera nodes got to be marked with leader=me. 
It just tells which node will run the first/initial galera instance.

Test your ini file:
> ansible -i $YOURFILE -m ping

Now you can run your first installation (as of 20131226 we support 
the RedHat OS family and coderhip installation).

> ansible-playbook -i $YOURFILE Playbook/multi_install.yaml

Playbook/multi_install.yaml is just a bunch of scripts. 
In the end you are going to have a running galera cluster with
all the testnodes pointing to the leader node for testing.


Great now run your first Test

> ansible-playbook -i $YOURFILE Playbook/multi_test.yaml

Great you are done.
The result file is stored in your /tmp. Fixed later :)
